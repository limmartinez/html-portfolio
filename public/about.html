<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Li and I work in marketing and fundraising currently. But I have always enjoyed learning new skills and topics, especially ones that let me be creative and work on solving problems. Hence, my foray into web dev.</p>

<p>I graduated from UT Austin studying journalism, communications, and marketing. I have a soft spot for jobs that will let me do a bit of good in the world while also getting to express myself.</p>

<p>Outside of work and learning, I love to study languages, read and write, and spend time outdoors.</p>
